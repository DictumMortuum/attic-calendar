name: Delphinia
description: 'The Delphinia was a festival of Apollo Delphinius held annually on the 6th (or 7th) of the month Munychion (April) in ancient Athens.All that is known of the ceremonies is that a number of girls proceeded to his temple (Delphinium) carrying suppliant''s branches and seeking to propitiate Apollo, probably as a god having influence on the sea. It was at this time of year that navigation began again after the storms of winter. According to the story in Plutarch (Theseus, 18), Theseus, before setting out to Crete to slay the Minotaur, repaired to the Delphinium and deposited, on his own behalf and that of his companions on whom the lot had fallen, an offering to Apollo, consisting of a branch of consecrated olive, bound about with white wool; after which he prayed to the god and set sail. The sending of the maidens to propitiate the god during the Delphinia commemorates this event in the life of Theseus. Ἑορτὴ πρὸς τιμὴν τοῦ Δελφινίου Άπόλλωνος πρὸς ἀνάμνησιν τῆς ἱκετηρίας τοῦ Θησέως. Σύμφωνως πρὸς τὸν μῦθον, ἡ 6ην Μουνυχιῶνος ἦταν ἡ ἡμέρα κατὰ τὴν ὁποίαν ἀπέπλευσε ὁ Θησεὺς μετὰ τῶν συντρόφων του διὰ τὴν Κρήτην, ὅπου ἐπρόκειτο νὰ προσφερθοῦν εἰς Μινώταυρον. Πρὶν φύγῃ ὁ Θησεὺς εἶχε ἐπισκεφθεῖ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Δελφινίου Ἀπόλλωνος, εὐρισκόμενο εἰς τὰς ὄχθας τοῦ Ἰλισσοῦ ποταμοῦ πλησίον τοῦ Ὀλυμπιεῖου ἱεροῦ τοῦ Διός, ὅπου ἀφιέρωσε ἱκετευτικὸν κλάδον ἐκ τῆς ἱερῆς ἐλαίας τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς, καλούμενον ἱκετηρία. Πρὸς ἀνάμνησιν τοῦ γεγονότος, οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τελοῦσαν Πομπὴν πρὸς τιμὴν τοῦ Δελφινίου Ἀπόλλωνος ὅπου νεαραὶ ἀνύπανδραι κόραι ντυμέναι ἐν λευκῷ προσέφεραν ἱκετηρία καὶ πόππανα.'
