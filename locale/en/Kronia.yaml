name: Kronia
description: 'The Kronia was an Athenian festival held in honor of Cronus (Kronos) on the 12th day of Hekatombaion, the first month of the Attic calendar and roughly equivalent to the latter part of July and first part of August. The festival was also celebrated in parts of Ionia, and in these places the month was known as Kronion after the festival.The Roman playwright Accius says that to celebrate the Kronia, "In nearly all fields and towns they happily feast upon banquets, and everyone waits upon his own servants."  Slaves and the free, rich and poor, all dined together and played games such as dice (kyboi), knucklebones (astragaloi), and the board game pessoi. The freedom from work and social egalitarianism enjoyed on the day represented the conditions of the mythical Golden Age, when Cronus still ruled the world. In the Golden Age, the earth had spontaneously supported human life, and since labor was unneeded, slavery had not existed: "it was a period of thorough harmony in which hierarchical, exploitative, and predatory relationships were nonexistent." Accius describes the Kronia in order to explain its perceived influence on the Roman Saturnalia.The Kronia was a time for social restraints to be temporarily forgotten. Slaves were released from their duties, and participated in the festivities alongside the slave-owners. Slaves were “permitted to run riot through the city, shouting and making a noise.” It is usually regarded as a celebration of the harvest. Other than the Kronia, there is only limited evidence of religious devotion to Cronus. Παλαιὰ ἀττικὴ ἑορτὴ πρὸς τιμήν τοῦ Κρόνου. Τὰ Κρόνια ἑορτάζονται τὴν 12ην Ἑκατομβαιῶνος πρὸς τιμὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ Κρόνου. Ἡ ἑορτὴ φαίνεται νὰ σχετίζεται μὲ ἀγροτικᾶς ἐργασίας καὶ πιθανῶς ἀφορᾶ τὸ τέλος τῆς περιόδου τῆς συγκομιδῆς. Εἶναι ἡμέρα ἀναπαύσεως ἀπὸ τὰς συνήθεις ἐργασίας ἐνῶ οὔτε ἡ Βουλὴ συνεδριάζει οὔτε καὶ ρυθμίζονται ζητήματα τῆς πόλεως. Εἰς τὸ ἐντὸς τῆς Ἀθηνῶν πόλεως Ἱερὸν τοῦ Κρόνου, πλησίον τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ Ὀλυμπίου Διός, ἑορταζόταν ἐτησίως διὰ τελετουργίας, περὶ τῆς ὁποίας ὅμως δὲν διασώζονται ἐπιγραφικαὶ μαρτυρίαι. Οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπίστευαν ὅτι παλαιοτέρως ὁ μὴν ὀνομαζόταν Κρονιῶν καὶ ὅτι ἀργότερα ὀνομάσθη Ἑκατομβαιῶν. Ὑπάρχουν ἐνδείξεις διὰ τὴν τέλεσιν παρομοῖας ἑορτῆς ἐν Ἰωνίᾳ, ποὺ ὅμως γινόταν τὸν προηγούμενον μήνα. Ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν Κρονίων ὑπῆρχε ἀπὸ πανάρχαιους χρόνους καὶ ἤδη ὁ Ἀριστοφάνης τὴν ἀντιμετωπίζει ὡς πεπαλαιωμένην. Ἡ ἡμέρα τῶν Κρονίων ἦταν ἀργία διὰ τοὺς δούλους, εἰς τοὺς ὁποίους ἐπιτρεπόταν νὰ δειπνήσουν τότε μετὰ τῶν κυρίων των καὶ γενικῶς νὰ συμπεριφερθοῦν κάπως πιὸ ἐλεύθερα. Τὸ ἔθιμον συναντοῦμε καὶ εἰς τὴν Ἀθήναν τῆς κλασσικῆς περιόδου, ὅπου παρότι τὸ ἀγροτικὸ στοιχεῖον τῆς κοινωνίας ἔχει ἐξασθενήσει ἐν τούτοις ἡ συνήθεια τοῦ κοινοῦ δείπνου διετηρήθη. Κάποιους αἰώνας ἀργότερα ὁ ἐκλεπτυσμένος Πλούταρχος παρατηρεῖ ὅτι "ὅταν οἱ ὑπηρέται συμποσιάζονται τῶν Κρονίων, ὁ θόρυβος καὶ ἡ φωνασκία των δὲν ἀντέχονται".'
