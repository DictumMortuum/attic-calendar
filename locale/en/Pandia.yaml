name: Pandia
description: 'In Greek mythology, the goddess Pandia or Pandeia (Greek: Πανδία, Πανδεία, meaning "all brightness")  was a daughter of Zeus and the goddess Selene, the Greek personification of the moon. From the Homeric Hymn to Selene, we have: "Once the Son of Cronos [Zeus] was joined with her [Selene] in love; and she conceived and bare a daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods." An Athenian tradition made Pandia the wife of Antiochus, the eponymous hero of Antiochis, one of the ten Athenian tribes (phylai).Originally Pandia may have been an epithet of Selene, but by at least the time of the late Homeric Hymn, Pandia had become a daughter of Zeus and Selene. Pandia (or Pandia Selene) may have personified the full moon, and an Athenian festival, called the Pandia, probably held for Zeus, was perhaps celebrated on the full-moon and may have been connected to her. Ἑορτὴ πιθανῶς ἀφιερωμένη εἰς Δία. Ἡ ἀκριβὴς ἡμερομηνία ἑορτασμοῦ τῶν Πανδίων μᾶς εἶναι ἄγνωστη ἀλλά προφανῶς συνέβαινε μετὰ τὰ Διονύσια, ἀφοῦ τὴν ἡμέραν ἔπειτα ἀπὸ τὰ Πάνδια ἐλάμβανε χώρα ἡ συνέλευσις ἀπολογισμοῦ τῶν Διονυσίων. Δὲν γνωρίζουμε τίποτε περὶ τῆς ἑορτῆς ἐκτὸς ἀπὸ τὸν προβληματισμὸν τῶν ἀρχαίων σχολιαστῶν περὶ τῆς σημασίας τοῦ ὀνόματός της. Μόνον μία περιοχή, ἡ Πλώθεια φαίνεται νὰ ἐόρταζε καὶ δὲν ὑπάρχουν ἐνδείξεις συμμετοχῆς τῶν ἄλλων κοινοτήτων τῆς Ἀττικῆς. Ἔχει προταθεῖ καὶ ἡ ὑπόθεσις ἡ ἑορτὴ νὰ σχετίζεται τρόπον τινὰ μὲ τὸν Πανδίονα, μυθικὸν βασιλέα τῆς Ἀττικῆς, καθὼς καὶ τὴν Πανδιονίδα φυλή.'
