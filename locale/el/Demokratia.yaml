  This festival, at which the Athenians celebrated democracy, included sacrifices to Zeus Agoraios, Athena Agoraia 
  and to the Goddess Themis.  Images of Zeus and Athena were paraded in the agora, the lower city below the Acropolis 
  (high city). Themis, one of the Titans, is “goddess of divine law–the primal, unwritten laws governing human conduct 
  which were first established by the gods of heaven. She was believed to have issued these edicts to mankind through 
  the great oracle of Delphoi over which she presided alongside the god Apollon” (theoi.com). Clearly, the 
  establishment of democracy in Athens was seen as a divine gift of Themis, especially, as well as Zeus (her father) and 
  Athena. Today: This is an opportunity to honor Themis and Zeus and Athena with libations and incense and other offerings. 
  The Orphic Hymn 79 to Themis is particularly relevant as is Orphic Hymn 37, to the Titans. It would also be appropriate 
  to give thanks for the political freedoms and rights we enjoy today.
